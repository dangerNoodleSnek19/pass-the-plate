[]The problem we are addressing is the disconnect in every community between those with excess food and those in need of food.
[]The general idea behind our solution was building an application that allows users (grocery stores, restaurants, churches?) who have excess food, to login and post listings where they can share the food that they are offering, the location of the food, and the window in which the food is available before its perishable. Then other users (literally anyone, schools, food banks, churches, individuals) can log in and have a home page that shows listings local to their location where food is available. With the ability to comment or message to coordinate a handoff.
[]Features we completed: Authentication, show listings by zipcode, show user listings, database
[]Stretch features:
--Post listings is partially finished
--the ability to show and post comments on listings is built out on the backend
--google maps API to connect people to local listings is a stretch feature
--Oauth for sign in is a stretch feature, images on the listings is a stretch features
--enhancements on CSS was something we had hoped to get to
[]We were excited about building this idea into something that could actually be usable because we feel strongly about the cause.
